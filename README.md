# Guess the Number Game in Rust

![Ferris the Crab](https://rustacean.net/assets/rustacean-orig-noshadow.svg)

Welcome to my first Rust application! This is a simple console game where the player needs to guess a number between 1 and 100. The application will guide the player by providing feedback whether their guess is too small, too big, or correct.

## How to Play

1. Run the application.
2. The game will prompt you to enter a guess.
3. If your guess is too small, the game will respond with "Too small!".
4. If your guess is too big, the game will respond with "Too big!".
5. If you guess the correct number, the game will respond with "You win!" and end the game.

## Installation

To play the game, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
